# Final Report

## Git Usage
- Used `git add`, `commit`, `push`, and `pull` to manage changes
- Resolved conflicts when restoring README.md
- Maintained clean commit history with descriptive messages

## Testing
- Validated sensor configs with unit tests
- Checked anomaly detection logic with out-of-range values
- Verified JSON parsing with `unitType` property

## Challenges
- Initial issue with `unitType` not displaying
- GitHub README not rendering due to duplicate files
- Debugging JSON copy-to-output settings

## Feature Development
- Implemented dynamic config loading
- Added multi-sensor and multi-location support
- Integrated unit display (°C, %RH)
- Built validation and anomaly detection

## Reflection
- Learned importance of audit-ready documentation
- Improved confidence with Git workflows
- Future improvement: threaded sensor execution and dashboard integration
- Leant alot of new skill in doing this project wasn't sure i was going to be able to do it at first but with a bit of help and determination i was able to complete it
